This bypass is dooky poopy, credit to bypassi, the greatest giant, and many more in the bypassi server.

Note that most people can't change DNS at school, and even if you do <#1059386432415879218> (which unblocks it), it probably will 
still refuse to connect. use a vpn instead

**Guide for how to change your DNS**

NOTE: There are 2 ways of doing it
1 - you can do it on your wifi
2 - you can do it on a VPN (recommended)

VIA Wi-fi
- Open your wifi settings
- Open up the `Network` dropdown and under `Name servers` click on `Custom name servers`
- Set the first box to the DNS you plan on using and the rest to `0.0.0.0`
Note: This might not automatically connect you so you can either go to `chrome://restart` right away and you should be connected or you can check by going to `chrome://network/#state`, clicking on the `+` next to your wifi and seeing if the nameservers is the one you set it to 

VIA VPN
- Go to the VPN settings - they can be accessed in settings or if they're blocked or you're a skid, go to `chrome://network/#select` and double click on the vpn
- Open up the `Network` dropdown and under `Name servers` click on `Custom name servers`
- Set the first box to the DNS you plan on using and the rest to `0.0.0.0`

DNS ip's:
GiantDNS: 158.101.114.159 - Properties - [swamp],  <#1059386563303321600> , and the blocking needed for <#1059385329733341254> 
[swamp] DNS: 150.136.6.90 - just has [swamp]
-
**[swamp] FOR GOGUARDIAN ONLY**
This bypass **only works if you have the GoGuardian extension installed**. Also, it does not work on ChromeOS 104 specifically.

This will allow you to:
-Disable force-installed extensions like <#1059386563303321600> even on Chrome 106 when it's patched
-Run bookmarklets on any page even when they are blocked
- **Break GoGuardian until powerwash** (or until you turn it back on)
- Run a custom filter to block network requests (such as to `goguardian.com`) without actually being on a DNS
-Run your own custom code with access to most of the `chrome` API

**Setup: (make sure GoGuardian is installed and enabled)** 
Basically just <#1059386377931857951> (note that this will likely not work on a school network)


Establishing spoofed connection:
- In a new tab, go to https://tinyurl.com/s-w-a-m-p (or ```chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/background
.html``` (should be a blank white screen)

- On this page, press ctrl+shift+r and wait for the page to finish loading (it should still be a blank screen)
- In the same tab, go to https://ssl.google-analytics.com/swamp (and maybe do ctrl+shifter)

-You should get a warning message from Chrome (if you do not, then there is an issue with your DNS setup, try a hotspot maybe)

-Type `thisisunsafe` on your keyboard to bypass this warning (make sure you don't typo)

You should now be in [swamp]! If you can keep pressing ctrl+shift+r on the extension page and (swamp] keeps loading, then you've set it up correctly. If it doesn't, then you'll have to go back to the Google Analytics link and do thisisunsafe again.

Please turn off the DNS when you're done. If you use too
much bandwidth, [swamp] will get slower for everyone.
Cheers! - Bypassi
