The method linked above involves less spamming. It doesn't work for all extensions, but it should work for your filter. However, it's also easier to block. The original instructions are shown below.

STEP ONE: Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. You'll need your extension's 32-character ID to continue. If you're trying to bypass stuff, try finding it in a filter extension ID list. For further help, check the help section.

Once you have the ID, you'll be guaranteed to get to a working chrome-extension:// page by visiting the manifest file: (with your extension's ID substituted in, of course)

chrome-extension://extension_id_here_please/manifest.json
Some extensions' pages are much easier to access directly (like their options or block pages). All that's important is that you open a page belonging to the extension you want to disable.

STEP TWO: Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark chrome://kill (B) and chrome://hang (C).

STEP THREE: While on the extension page (A), click the chrome://kill bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared.

STEP FOUR: Instantly start spamming chrome://hang (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming using the refresh key on your keyboard (or less ideally, ctrl+R). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page.

A timeline of the exploit can be seen below:


If you are unable to visit the extension page (bookmark A) after trying the exploit, then LTMEAT worked! Please read the help section if you had an issue (for example, if no sites seem to load). You can restore extensions by signing out and back into your Chromebook.


Note that the steps above are by no means the only way to perform the exploit. I'll add the first alternate set of instructions on May 11th for people affected by patches.
